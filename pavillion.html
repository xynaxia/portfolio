                    <p>Offices are pleasant spaces that facilitate focussed work, warm social encounters, engaging collaborations and inspiration. Offices are also very intuitive, socially driven and tactile spaces. So, how can people behave intuitively and comfortably and still make sure they stay healthy when viral infection is more likely than before?                    </p>

                    <p>Researching and analysing research is what I most enjoy about a project. To get a good idea of the current situation I have done extensive UX research with over twenty user interviews, user shadowing and tons of desk research I collected massive amounts of data. One of the problems with doing so much research is drowning in my own data...</p>

                    <p>Ensuring my insights are sharable, I’ve clustered the interviews through qualitative coding, turned the themes into clusters, formulated insight statements, further researched these insights to validate them and shared them with my project managers turning them into actions through design principles.</p>

                <div class="article-text">
                    <p>To generate ideas my first action was to find a lot of inspiration. For bringing people together, I’ve looked at social platforms. The most interesting thing I found here was that people were brought together through the use of events. With this in mind I organised a brainstorming session with three other people, to think of how this could apply to offices.</p>

                    <p>Another point of interest was spontaneity. This was a paradox… Needing to control and manage space, while at the same time stimulating free interaction. Here I took inspiration from other technology, a big one was a smart toilet in shanghai used for decreasing the waiting queues at the toilet. What was especially interesting here was that the technology was used to guide people, rather than controlling where they go. This was a principle I took with me when I designed my own smart solution.

                <div class="article-text">
                    <p>Eventually I was left with three concepts… These concepts were presented to the case owners and shared with the people to get some external feedback. The first concept I went for was coughy. Coughy was a smart coffee machine that attempted to nudge people into keeping distance. </p>

                <div class="article-text">
                    <p>Coughy had a face and displayed emotions based on sensor data. He would get worried when it got too busy and stare at people who were standing too close. The data for measuring this were thermal sensors. 
                    </p>
                    <p>However, as fun as the concept was. I decided to kill my darling. This concept was covid centered, not human centered. I got too excited because the idea sounded funny, but from a people perspective it was very gimmicky.
