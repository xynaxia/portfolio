                    <p>Pavillion is a social network based on smart-office technology. The core concept is <strong>bringing people together</strong> safely, by using gathering points. These gathering points each have their own function. They can be work related, such as finding someone with specific knowledge. But also informal, such as finding someone to take a walk outside. </p>

                    <p>Offices are pleasant spaces that facilitate <strong>focussed work, warm social encounters, engaging collaborations and inspiration.</strong> Offices are also very intuitive, socially driven and tactile spaces. So, how can people behave <strong>intuitively and comfortably</strong> and still make sure they <strong>stay healthy</strong> when viral infection is more likely than before?</p>

                    <p>The first action was creating a behavioural map. To collect data for this behavioural map I spent a few days shadowing people during lunch hours. Doing this I was able to gain objective observation behaviour. </strong></p>
                    <p>First Observations</p>
                    <ul class="case-list">
                        <li>People did not follow the arrows indicating the walk paths for the coffee machine. </li>
                        <li>Coffee machines are a popular place for small-talk, many people linger around and have conversations.</li>
                        <li>People in the open space collaborating often don’t keep their distance, especially when they are both looking at the same laptop screen.</li>

                    <figure class="case-figure"><img src="img/FloorPlan.png" alt="" srcset=""></figure>
                    <p>Further diving into research, I started doing the interviews with the employees from Cognizant. I interviewed about 15 people, In total transcribed 30K words of interview data. Used qualitative coding to find themes, and turned these themes into affinity diagrams. These interviews had three primary goals. </p>

                <div class="article-text">
                    <p>To research why people didn’t follow guidelines, I attempted to research something called a Health Belief. Interview questions were structured based on the Health Belief Model used in psychology for researching health perception.</p>
                    <ul class="case-list">
                        <li>People don’t follow the walk paths because the effort in doing so is deemed to be more than the perceived benefit. This means that the extra effort for taking a longer route is not something people view as beneficial for the risk. </li>
                        <li>The assumption that people follow COVID guidelines from the incentive of health is wrong. People follow guidelines because of conformity. People don’t see covid as a threat to their personal health. </li>
                        <li>People value self-responsibility. People find themselves smart enough to be responsible for their own health. When an authority questions this responsibility this is experienced as an annoyance. </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>In my context the office itself can be seen as a product. Especially since the case owner wants a smart office. This is why I used a value proposition instead of a persona. The office is used as an instrument for specific goals, that are paired with pains and gains. Based on the results I created design principles for ideation.</p>

                    <p><strong>Spontaneity:</strong> People want unpredictability. Unplanned encounters, random small talk. This stimulates inspiration and motivation.</p>
                    <p><strong>Bringing People Together:</strong> Now more than ever, people want to be together. Colleagues aren’t just colleagues, they are considered like friends.</p>
                    <p><strong>Real Interaction:</strong> People want to interact face to face, in the same room, seeing each other. They want interaction to feel “Real”. </p>

                </div>
                <div class="article-text">
                    <p>Controlling and managing space, while also stimulating serendipity seems like a paradox. <strong>To see how spontaneity and smart technology came together</strong>, I searched for some inspiration. The most interesting one was <strong>a smart toilet in Shanghai.</strong> The goal of this was to decrease waiting queues at the toilets. What I learned from this was that one way of managing space is not to control where people go, but to <strong>guide them in making the best choice.</strong> This was a principle I took with me when I designed my own smart solution.</p>
                    <img src="img/smart-toilet.jpeg" alt="" srcset="">
                    <p>Eventually I was left with three concepts… These concepts were presented to the case owners and shared with the people to get some external feedback. The first concept I went for was coughy. <strong>Coughy was a smart coffee machine</strong> that attempted to guide people with keeping distance.</p>
                    <img src="img/coughy.png" alt="" srcset="">
                    <p>Coughy had a face and displayed emotions based on sensor data. He would get worried when it got too busy and stare at people who were standing too close. The data for measuring this were thermal sensors. However, as fun as the concept was. <strong>I decided to kill my darling.</strong> This concept was covid centered, not human centered. I got too excited because the idea sounded funny, but from a people perspective it was very gimmicky. Since I haven't truly killed my darling, I've written a <strong>separate case</strong> for the rationale behind Coughy...</p>

                <div class="article-text">
                    <p>The final concept was Pavillion. The idea was to <strong>combine event based social networks and a GIS format.</strong> Using the idea from events to bring people together, the idea of the GIS format as a meta representation of the office, giving employees a bird eye perspective of things that are happening in the office that <strong>they can't see by looking around.</strong> </p>

                    <p>These events act as gathering points. <strong>The events were based on the JTBD</strong> that were discovered in the research. Things such as; finding someone to take a walk outside during the break, quickly finding people for some collaborative event (brainstorming, prototype testing, etc). But also finding experts on specific subjects in order to use the <strong>collective knowledge</strong> of the employees for the projects. </p>

                <div class="article-text">
                    <p>Having tested it multiple times I had many interesting insights. Beside optimisations, the most important insight in the end were:</p>
                    <p><strong>1:</strong> People who have the goal to socialize, or do something in the physical space, don’t want to spend time in an interface. Therefor the interaction in the device must be as short as possible.</p>
                    <p><strong>2:</strong> Focus on the open space. Because meeting rooms are usually booked and there are many better alternatives for booking meetings, the USP of Pavillion isn’t booking rooms, it is booking areas in the open space. </p>
                    <p><strong>3:</strong> Smart settings. Creating events requires a lot of details, such as how many people, what kind of event, which location, etc. This greatly increases the interaction cost of the product. By using smart settings preferences can be predicted.</p>

                    <p>The most important thing I’ve learned about this project is effective use of design principles and guidelines.

Before this I always felt my research, ideation and testing was disconnected.</p>
