                <p>Drinking buddy is a smart mug, with two major functions. It will make sure the barman will put enough alcohol in your mug and also prevent roofying.

                <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <p>This concept was done in a rapid prototyping week, to design and prototype at the same time. My main role was using technically realizing the product..

                <h1>Arduino</h1>
                <p>To realize the concept I used a water level sensor. The idea was that when enough water was added it would turn green, otherwise it would stay red. 
                </p>
                <p>For the high-fi prototype we used a beer mug, laser cutted a wooden casing and an arduino. In this wooden casing we could hide the arduino. Now the prototype was ready to be tested. </p>

                <h1>The Prototype</h1>
                <p>We tested the prototype with Ibuprofen as the drug. While testing this I noticed the sensor values didn’t make sense anymore. I discovered Ibuprofen influences acidity of the water, meaning the conductivity will also be affected.

                </p>
                <p>I made this flaw work in my favor. I now knew if I’d add Ibuprofen to clean water, the water level sensor would read suddenly read all values higher. Thus, if the sensor value would get higher than X the prototype would start flickering. 
                </p>
                <p>Eventually after presenting the concept, our team won the prize for the most awesome product!</p>
