                    <p>There are many financial solutions. However, most of them are based upon rational choice theory. Research has shown (Daniel Kahneman) that the choices we make are not rational. This is why I’ve attempted to make a tool to help people save money.</p>

                    <p>My users are millennials in the Netherlands with a hedonistic live in the moment mentality. My user has a short-term orientation, which conflicts with their ability to save money. They don’t lack the income to save, just the control. </p>
                    <p>To research the perception of money and saving I set up a research plan with different iterations. I’ve done this by doing some roleplay with the user. To test the balance between saving and spending, I gave them monopoly money. To test emotion tied to those purchases I’ve asked them to map their purchases on a graph I designed. </p>

                <div class="article-text">
                    <p>I’ve found that pending money on a shared experience with another person is considered meaningful, because it contributes to social relationships with another person. This is whty I decided to go for a ‘group-saving’ concept. </p>
                    <img src="img/buddy-based.png" alt="">
                    <p>My users save in sprints. This is why I introduced goal based saving. Smaller milestones, being part of the bigger picture. This also helps with their short-term orientation. </p>
                    <img src="img/goal-based.png" alt="">
                    <p>Loss Aversion (Daniel Kahneman) states that people prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains: it is better to not lose $5 than to find $5. This is why I’ve included saving debt. If you miss your savings, you will be in debt to your own goal and in group based saving, others will see that you are in debt. </p>
