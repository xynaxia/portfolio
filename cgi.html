                <h1>Introduction (WIP CASE)</h1>
                <p>We did this project for CGI, with a team of 4 people (2 designers, 2 developers). The project lasted about 7 weeks. In these 7 weeks I’ve mainly done research. We’ve chosen to focus on water quality. For this we’ve created a remote sensing interface for the Waterboards.</p>

                <h1>Research Satellites</h1>
                <p>With desk research I’ve learned about the powers of satellite data and how and where to access this data. This way I could easily present this to the developers, so that they could work with this data. I’ve made posters to easily represent this data.                </p>

                <h1>Research Waterboards</h1>
                <p>Since we focused on cyanobacterie, I’ve decided to contact different organisations. This way I’ve gotten to meet two people from the water authorities. By doing this I’ve gained a lot of understanding about the problem context.                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>It’s not about aiming for the best possible water quality, but a balanced water quality. If the quality of water gets too good, waterplants impedes fisherman, recreational sailors and they can also block the pumps.                     </li>
                    <li>The current monitoring network only has insight in < 8% of all total water, these are mostly cities. Duckweed often grows outside cities, but will come inside cities with the current. Because of this it’s hard to detect the source of growth.</li>

                <h1>Solution</h1>
                <p>The solution was to use Remote Sensing for the waterboards. For this we can design software. A lot of this software exists for scientist, however this is highly complex and hard to use. How might we be able to design something simpler, specifically tailored to the needs of the waterboards? </p>
                <p>After presenting a small prototype to the waterboards, I’ve attempted to really learn what they wanted to see in this prototype. What were the specific functions they wanted to have in the program?</p>

                <h1>Design</h1>
                <p>With that I’ve discovered the most important factors the application should have is to be able to detect change over time, biodiversity, wind-direction, water temperature, water turbidity and water depth. </p>
                <p>By viewing the same image in different spectrums, we can give the waterboards unique insights. Using timelapses, they can have insight in growth rates. Also adding wind direction data, they could predict where algae will go. </p>
                <p>When combining water depth and temperature, they can predict the likelihood of algae of duckweed growing. With that they can also see which areas might need to be dredged.</p>

                <p>Biodiversity is and indirect measure of quality of water. However, satellites aren’t high-definition enough to be able to measure this. This is why drones would be needed for this to work. However, since Rotterdam is close to the airport, drone regulations are strict.</p>

                <p>The waterboards themselves have a lot of sensors poles in lakes as well. They also take water monsters in order to measure different compounds in the water. Though this is often done by external companies.</p>
