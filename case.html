        <h1>Introduction</h1>
    </div>
    <p>We did this project for <span><a href="https://www.cginederland.nl/nl" target="_blank">CGI</a></span>, with a team of 4 people (2 designers, 2 developers). The project lasted about 7 weeks. In these 7 weeks I’ve mainly done research. We’ve chosen to focus on water quality. For this we’ve created a remote sensing interface for the Waterboards.</p>

        <h1>Research Satellites</h1>
    </div>
    <div>
    <p>My first step was to research the possibilities of the satellite data. With desk research I’ve found the EU copernicus challenge where I could see different projects. In these projects I could also see which data they used. 
            <br>
            <br>
            With the help of social media (Reddit) I’ve found the satellite sub. Here I asked around and I was quickly informed about Remote Sensing. Eventually I’ve learned about the Google Earth Engine API. I gave this to the developers and I’ve also made three posters of satellites to present my research.</p>

        <h1>Research Waterquality</h1>
    </div>
    <div>
    <p>With researching water quality I’ve decided to contact different organisations so that I could interview them. Here I’ve gotten two responses. One was from the Delfland waterboard and another from the Hollandse Delta. Here I’ve learned that it’s much more valuable to talk to experts instead of doing your own research. Based on my <span><a href="Interview Joep van de Koning.pdf" target="_blank">transcripts</a></span>, I’ve found these insights.
            <br>
            <br>
            <span>1:</span>  You don’t want the best water quality. Good water quality means there will be many water plants. Water plants impedes fisherman, recreational sailors and they can also block the pumps. Therefore the concept must focus on balancing water quality, rather than improving it. 

            <br>
            <br>
            <span>2:</span> The current monitoring network only has insight in < 8% of all total water, these are mostly cities. Duckweed often grows outside cities, but will come inside cities with the current. Because of this it’s hard to detect the source of growth.
            <br>
            <br>
            <span>3:</span>  Bad water quality is often perceived as normal. This is why it’s hard to rely on citizen data. Cloudy water and a lot of duckweed coverage is everywhere. 
        </p>

    <img src="img/waterschap.png" class="loadInVp"> 
    <p class="image-text">Here I am testing the concept with my user. This was Joep De koning, who is one of the water ecologists of the Delfland waterboard. I've collected some feedback to ask what kind of functions he would like to see. Thereby I don't just make the design decisions myself, but let the user choose, since he knows a lot more about the subject than I do.</p>

        <h1>Concept</h1>
    </div>
    <div>
    <p>Based on all insights and the waterboards input we’ve concluded that insight is the main problem surrounding water quality. Therefore we’ve decided to create a remote sensing interface for the waterboards. So that they can prevent and predict bad water quality before this happens. The functions are explained in the wireframes.</p>

        <p class="image-text">Here you can see the interface. Here you can also see the ‘over time’ function. The waterboards wanted this function so they could easily measure change over times. This function works best in combination with others. </p>

        <div id="screen-2" class="image-item"></div>
        <p class="image-text">Here you can see the algae bloom. This method works because the chlorophyll level of both algae and duckweed it much higher than anything else in the water. This way you can measure it with satellite data. </p>

        <div id="screen-3" class="image-item"></div>
        <p class="image-text">Here you can see notifications send in by citizens. With this concept we hope to include fisherman and sailors. They can easily update and image if they encounter a problem. By doing this the algorithm can be trained using citizens, </p>

    <div class="image-container-item">
        <div id="screen-4" class="image-item"></div>
        <p class="image-text">Here you can see the water depth. This is useful to know in order to predict if blue algae will happen. Shallow water is much more likely to get warm than deep water. Because of this algae will be more likely to grow. </p>
