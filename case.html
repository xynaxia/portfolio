        <h1>Introductie</h1>
    </div>
    <p>Did this project for <span>CGI Inc</span>. The project lasted 7 weeks and we were four. We did this project together with the CMGT training. There were two developers, two designers. My role in the project was primarily research. For example, I did research into the problem context and the possibilities of satellite data. To frame ourselves, we have chosen to focus on blue-green algae.
            <br>
            <br>
    In this project I mainly focus on my own research. Everything that is discussed here is therefore mainly the one that I have done myself.</p>

        <h1>Research Satellites</h1>
    </div>
    <p>My first step was to investigate satellites. I wanted to know exactly what was possible and how it worked. I did this through different ways. First, I have found existing projects on the <span>Copernicus Program</span>. I soon noticed that many projects used the same kind of data sets. I also searched for experts in this field through Reddit. Soon I was referred to <span>Remote Sensing</span>.
            <br>
            <br>
            Remote Sensing: You can analyze the earth through remote sensing. So you can also see blue algae from space with the data from <span>Sentinel 2</span>. Temperature with Sentinel 3. I also found where I could get this data. This was from the <span>Google Earth API</span>. I passed this on to the developers, so that they could figure out how to implement this technically.</p>

    <p>First IÃ¥? wanted to do research on blue-green algae. I have sent many e-mails to water boards. This gave me the opportunity to talk to the Delfland Water Board and the <span>Dutch Delta Water Board</span>. My goal was to gain a better understanding of the problem situation. These were my insights.
            <br>
            <br>
            <span>1:</span> Duckweed & blue-green algae often block the light, causing the plants underneath to die. Dying plants causes oxygenlessness in the water and dredging. Dredging costs the water board money and oxygenlessness causes <span>H2S</span>. H2S smells very bad and is not very healthy.
            <br>
            <br>
            <span>2:</span>  Optimizing water quality is not the goal. It is to maintain a balance between good and bad water quality. With good water quality there will be many water plants. An excess of aquatic plants impedes fisherman and recreational sailors. They can also block the pumps.
            <br>
            <br>
            <span>3:</span>  The current monitoring network of the water board has less than 8% of all water in sight. So the biggest problem is insight. You need this insight for a good balance of water quality.</p>

    <p>"How do we give the water board a better view of the water so that they can prevent anoxic water?"</p>
    <p>Combining the data of the citizen (Fishermen, recreational sailors, other reports), water board and Remote Sensing. This data is then primarily the data that helps to clarify the water quality. The data that we want to collect are the following:

            Alga & Duckweed Coverage: make with the Sentinel 2 tires apply to the NDVI there.
            <br>
            <br>
            Plant diversity: plant diversity provides an indirect picture of water quality. Through data from Sentinel 1 and LIDAR, we can analyze the diversity.
            <br>
            <br>
            Water Depth & Turbidity: By measuring the color of the water we can determine how turbid it is, but also how deep it is. For this you need high resolution satellite images, for example from Digitalglobe.
            <br>
            <br>
            Water: Through the sensors and water samples from the water board we can also have a good idea about the chemicals in the water.</p>
